Try to split your text up into different files. This helps you move blocks of text around and can make it easier to collaborate as your coauthors can work on different parts of the document simultaneously.

In this template, the main file that needs to be compiled to create the PDF is \emph{main.tex}. I use this naming convention to help editors and coauthors identify where to start. I then use \verb+\input{}+ to import other files into my main file at compilation.

Each of the chapters and sections in this document are in separate files, called \emph{WhatIsLatex}, \emph{LatexForDocs}, and so-on. They are stored in the \emph{../DemoFiles} directory so that each of the \emph{Corporate*.cls} files can use the same text.

My \emph{main.tex} file has a simple internal structure:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]Tex}]
\documentclass[option 1, ..., option n]{CorporateArticle}
...
\begin{document}
% content
\input{files/WhatIsLatex}
\input{files/LatexForDocs}
...
\end{lstlisting}

There are very few if any lines in the preamble; almost all of the document formatting is inside the \emph{Corporate*.cls} and \emph{CorporateResources.sty} files.
