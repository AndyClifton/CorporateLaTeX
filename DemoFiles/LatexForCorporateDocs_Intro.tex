Corporate documents usually try to have a common look and feel. They do this by using consistent fonts, colours, spacing and other graphic elements across all of their written products. This is challenging to achieve using WYSIWYG editors, especially if the author is given any leeway in document formatting.

This document and the associated examples in the repository show how a common corporate design can be implemented and -- to some degree -- hidden from the user, in LaTeX. They use the \emph{corporate*.cls} files to implement common formatting in LaTeX articles and reports.
