LaTeX is a mark-up language that describes how a document should be prepared.

Three things are needed to make a LaTeX document:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A source latex document
\item Some packages and classes that help turn what's in the source document into something helpful
\item A compiler, also referred to as a working LaTeX installation.
\end{enumerate}

LaTeX source files are usually rendered into PDF, but can also be turned in to HTML and proprietary formats such as .docx. 

At first glance the source document looks like a programming language, and that's because it is: LaTeX is not WYSIWYG, like many of the document preparation tools in common use today. A good analogy to LaTeX is html code, which can be read in any text editor but is rendered by web browsers into a finished product.
