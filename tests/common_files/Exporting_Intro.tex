LateX source files are usually converted into PDF files. But, they can be converted into other formats for easier editing or for publishing to the internet.

The best approach to exporting LaTeX documents is to use \emph{Pandoc} to parse the .tex source and reformat it for other uses.

Pandoc is an open-source program that you have to install. Details can be found at \href{https://pandoc.org/}{https://pandoc.org/}.

Pandoc is called from the command line / terminal of your computer:

\lstset{language = bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
pandoc -s ArticleMain.tex -o pandocDemo.docx
\end{lstlisting}


An example.docx file generated using pandoc 2.03 is included in this repository.
