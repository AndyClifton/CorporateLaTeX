#Introduction
This is the repository for a LaTeX class file and example template document that can be used to produce LaTeX documents that conform to NREL's style guide. The file also includes instructions for converting the document into a rich text format (.rtf) file, which can be read by WYSIWYG editors.

NREL staff should check on [The Source](http://thesource.nrel.gov/communications/templates.html) for current guidance on using LaTeX for NREL documents. NREL staff are strongly encouraged to check in with their communications rep before starting to use LaTeX for documents.

#Installing and using the latex class file
The nrel.cls and nrel.bst files should be installed either in your local latex tree or in the same directory as your .tex source files. If you don't know how to do this, you may wish to rethink your idea of using LaTeX to produce your document.

#Documentation
Documentation is provided in the example .pdf file, https://github.com/NREL/latex_editing/blob/master/intro_to_NREL_latex.pdf.
