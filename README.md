# Introduction 
This is the repository for LaTeX class files and template documents that can be used to produce articles, reports, and presentations that conform to NREL's style guide. 

# Requirements
## Web-based documents
1. NREL has implemented a web-based latex editor. This can be found at latex.nrel.gov

## Desktop document preparation
1. A working installation of Latex. Please install the most up-to-date version possible. LaTeX can be obtained from e.g. http://tug.org/texlive/ or https://tug.org/mactex/.
2. Some experience with using latex to produce journal articles or reports.

# Files

# Documentation
Documentation for producing documents or presentations is provided in the `readme.md` file that can be found in each directory. A template is also provided.

# Reporting issues and errors
Please use the issue-tracker at https://github.com/NREL/latex_editing/issues to report issues.

# Wiki
Please use the wiki at https://github.com/NREL/latex_editing/wiki as you feel fit. Useful examples may be rolled in to the template file over time.

# Instructions for NREL staff
NREL staff should check on [The Source](http://thesource.nrel.gov/communications/templates.html) for current guidance on using LaTeX for NREL documents.

Please also note that there is an NREL-hosted latex server at [latex.nrel.gov](latex.nrel.gov) which is the preferred tool for preparing NREL documents.

NREL staff must check in with their communications representatives before starting to use LaTeX for documents.
